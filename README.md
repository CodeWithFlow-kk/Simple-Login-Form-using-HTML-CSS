# Simple-Login-Form-using-HTML-CSS
A clean, lightweight login form with floating labels (like Google’s), built with semantic HTML and minimal CSS—includes smooth label animation, basic client-side validation, and autofill/autosuggest suppression for a polished UX. No backend; meant as a front-end UI demo or starter.
